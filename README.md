## General Info
This project is a simple image repository that allows users to upload, download, and delete images. Every user must create an account with a username and password. Once they are logged in, they can interact with photos in their personal private libaray or the global public libary (which everyone can access).
	
## Technologies
This project was built with:
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
	
## Setup
The `main.py` will attempt to automatically install the necessary libraries itself using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

If errors are encoutered, you can attempt to install it yourself using the following command.
```bash
pip install pillow
```
