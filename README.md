## General Info
This project is a simple image repository that allows users to upload, download, and delete images. Every user must create an account with a username and password. Once they are logged in, they can interact with photos in their personal private libaray or the global public libary (which everyone can access).
	
## Setup
Create a folder such as `Image Repository` somewhere on your computer and place the `main.py` file inside of it. When `main.py` is run, it will create numerous folders to organize data within its current working directory. Thus, it is important to place it in a brand new folder where it is free to run and create its own file system.


When the `main.py` file is run, it will attempt to automatically install the necessary libraries itself using the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

If errors are encoutered, you can attempt to manually install the required [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) library using the following command.
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Running the Project

```bash
pytho

## Built With
This project uses:
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
